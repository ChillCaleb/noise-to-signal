Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman delivered opening remarks at the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act Outreach Meeting. The meeting is part of a third public outreach process hosted by federal banking agencies. Bowman emphasized the need to simplify the bank regulatory system, which has become overly complicated with conflicting and overlapping requirements. The goal is to reduce unnecessary costs on banks and their customers. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) process aims to review and update regulations to eliminate outdated ones and reduce burden. The core result is a call for a more balanced regulatory framework that encourages economic growth and innovation while ensuring the safety and stability of the banking system.
